Alcohol use has been identified as a risk factor for TB recurrence and mortality in TB patients. People who consume alcohol have a greater risk of relapse and mortality from TB than those who do not consume alcohol.


Possible causal pathways include specific social mixing patterns among people with alcohol use disorders, leading to higher risk of infection, or weakened immune system leading to higher risk of break down from infection to TB disease.


This repository is showing how many alcohal addicted people are suffering from this problem in every state of India. This is just for general awarness.
